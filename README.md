# Flutter Base

A common base code for Flutter projects using **Clean Architecture** and **MVVM**. The structure is familiar and easy to approach for any developer. While some Flutter-specific features are used, they’re explained clearly below.

Follow this [guide](docs/GUIDE.md) to apply the base.

## 🧰 Environment

- Recommended: macOS or Linux
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Flutter plugins installed

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation)

3. Install the project-specific Flutter version via FVM

```bash
fvm install
```
> ⚠️ **Important**: Please restart VSCode after running this command successfully.

4. Install dependencies and generate necessary files

```bash
make gen
```

5. Run the project using the VSCode debugger

## 🧱 Architecture

Based on:

- [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)
- [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

## 🔌 DI Management

- Using [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for dependency injection and state management

## 🎯 Coding Style

- Follows [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart)

## 🖼️ Asset Generation

- Handled by [FlutterGen](https://github.com/FlutterGen/flutter_gen)

## 🧊 Model Generation

- Using [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for immutable models and union types

## ✅ Unit Tests

- Mocks generated by [Mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito)
- Tests written with `flutter_test`

## 🛠 Utilities

ℹ️ If you are on **Windows**, install `make` via [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows)

* Generate resources

```bash
make gen
```

- Watch for changes and auto-regenerate

```bash
make watch
```

- Lint, format check, and run unit tests

```bash
make validate
```

- Create a new screen module

_Requires [mason_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli)_

```bash
make screen
```
